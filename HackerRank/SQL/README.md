## Notes
- The MySQL version being used in the platform is old and does not support CTEs
- The solutions provided are either for MySQL or MS SQL Server or both
- Some of the _medium_ to _hard_ difficulty questions are poorly worded/explained

## Updates
Solutions may be revised after I learn about query optimization as this aspect was not considered during this first pass.
