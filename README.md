# Coding Practice üíª

This repository contains solutions to coding problems I've tackled in the past from online Coding interview prep platforms like [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), and [Educative](https://www.educative.io/). Solution notes, when available, are embedded as comments in the code. They are usually provided on _medium_ to _hard_ difficulty problems so I can remind myself of what my thought process was.

This repo will mainly be for my own reference as I try to become more proficient in a couple of programming languages, or try to learn a new one. If you happen to find this repo, feedback is welcome so feel free to reach out by email or on my socials if you have comments, criticisms, or corrections you'd like to raise.

## üìù Tips | üí° Observations

- _Easy_ problems usually only tests for basic problem solving skills and your command of your chosen programming language.
- _Medium_ to _Hard_ problems often require application of more advanced data structures or known CS algorithms to clear the problem.
- It's faster to code in Python or Javascript as they are less verbose compared to something like C++ or Java.
- Articulating your thought process while solving a coding problem takes skill.
- There are several poorly-written problems in HackerRank. Perhaps this is intentional to allow for opportunities to showcase your skill at clarifying vague problem descriptions with an interviewer.

## üõ†Ô∏è Future updates

- Leetcode solutions will be uploaded next. I will try to sift through them first as they were written at a time when I didn't bother adding solution notes and comments.
- I attempt at least one coding problem per day but the new solutions will be uploaded in chunks when I clear a section of them in the coding platforms, or when I finish a substantial amount.
